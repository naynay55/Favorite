# My Favorite Activity
## Watching movies and shows

I watch my movies and shows on many platfroms such as Netflix, Hulu, and Hbo Max. I enjoy it so much because that's how I learned how to speak English. My reaons are:

1. A good to spend time with friends and family.
2. I learn something new **everytime!**
3. I enjoy my time being spent watching movies to relax and not worry about *anything.*
